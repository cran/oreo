Description: The Sequence of Physical Processes (SPP) framework is a way of interpreting the transient data derived from oscillatory rheological tests. It is designed to allow both the linear and non-linear deformation regimes to be understood within a single unified framework. This code provides a convenient way to determine the SPP framework metrics for a given sample of oscillatory data. It will produce a text file containing the SPP metrics, which the user can then plot using their software of choice. It can also produce a second text file with additional derived data (components of tangent, normal, and binormal vectors), as well as pre-plotted figures if so desired. It is the R version of the Package SPP by Simon Rogers Group for Soft Matter (Simon A. Rogers, Brian M. Erwin, Dimitris Vlassopoulos, Michel Cloitre (2011) <doi:10.1122/1.3544591>).
